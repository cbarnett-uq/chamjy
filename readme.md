# Conductify

## Compiling Project

### System requirements

Conductify is uses Expo to build for iOS and Android mobile platforms. To compile the codebase, you will need to have Node and Expo Go installed on your mobile device.

Node: https://nodejs.org/en/

Install Expo Go on your Mobile Device via the App Store or Google Play. https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/

### Install

1. Using a CLI, navigate to the root directory of the code base.
2. Run the command:
    ```
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    ```

### Run
1. Using a CLI, navigate to the root directory of the code base.
2. Run the command:
    ```
    npx expo start
    ```
3. Once the expo has started the server, a QR code will appear.
4. If you are using iOS, scan the QR code using the Camera app - then tap the notification to open in Expo Go. If you are using Android, scan the QR code using the Expo Go app.
